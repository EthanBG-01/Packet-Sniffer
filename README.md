# Linux Command Line Packet-Sniffer in C
A Packet sniffer that runs on Linux Terminal [Requires root privilidges].

## Motivations
This year at University, I have an OS and Networking module, which also teaches programming in C. Therefore, as preparation, I created this basic packet sniffer to gain a better foundation in this area. This project contains two files; `packetSniffer.c`, which makes use of libpcap, and  `packetSniffer_rawSocket.c`: both achieve the same results through different means.
